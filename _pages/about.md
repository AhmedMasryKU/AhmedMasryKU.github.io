I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">York University</a> supervised by <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/enamulh/index.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Prof. Enamul Hoque</a>. My research focuses on developing multimodal vision-language models and benchmarks for chart, table, and document comprehension. I earned my Master of Science in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">York University</a> in 2022 and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Koc University in 2020, supported by the fully-funded Al Ghurair Foundation (AGFE) STEM scholarship.

My research, published in top-tier conferences such as **ACL 2022**, **EuroVis 2022**, **EMNLP 2023**, **ACL 2024**, **EMNLP 2024**, **COLING 2025**, and **ICLR 2025**, as well as workshops at **Neurips 2024**, **ICLR 2025**, **AAAI 2024** and **CVPR 2021** (where I received the **Best Paper Award**), focuses on advancing chart understanding benchmarks (e.g., ChartQA, Chart2Text) and models (e.g., UniChart, ChartInstruct, ChartGemma). These contributions have been widely adopted, accumulating over **100,000 downloads** on open-source platforms like <a hred="https://huggingface.co/ahmed-masry" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Hugging Face</a>. Notably, our <a href="https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">ChartQA benchmark</a> has been featured as a key multimodal evaluation benchmark by **OpenAI’s GPT-4** official blog post and **Google’s Gemini** paper in evaluating their models visual reasoning capabilities. As of March 7th, 2025, my publications have received **946 citations**, and I have an **h-index of 9** on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XqPX5XcAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is also supported by funding awards such as the **Google PaliGemma Academic Award**.

Professionally, I have worked as a Senior Data Scientist at Arteria AI, leading multimodal document understanding projects for clients in the finance and legal industries in Canada between 2022 and 2024. Currently, I am a visiting researcher at **ServiceNow Research**, where I focus on designing novel vision-language large model (VLMs) architectures for multimodal document understanding and training cutting-edge VLLMs (e.g., LLama 3.2, Phi3.5, Idefics-3) on large compute clusters with multi-node H100 GPUs.
