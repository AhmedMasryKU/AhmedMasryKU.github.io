I am currently working as an **NLP Data Scientist** at <a href="https://www.arteria.ai/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Arteria AI</a>. Prior to that, I completed my M.Sc. (Thesis-based) in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">York University</a> where I was working as a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/enamulh/index.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Prof. Enamul Hoque</a>. in collaboration with <a href="https://raihanjoty.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Prof. Shafiq Joty</a>, who is currently a research director at <a href="https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Salesforce AI Research</a>. My research focused on multimodal charts understanding tasks, such as answering questions about charts, summarizing charts, and extracting data from charts.

Our research work has been published in several prestigious venues such as **ACL 2022**, **CVPR 2021**, **EuroVis 2022**, and **EMNLP 2023**. Moreover, our work has gained considerable attention; our <a href="https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">ChartQA benchmark</a> has been featured as a key multimodal evaluation benchmark by **OpenAI's GPT-4** official blog post and **Google's Gemini** paper in evaluating their models visual reasoning capabilities.
