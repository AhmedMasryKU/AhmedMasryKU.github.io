I am currently working as a **Senior Data Scientist** at <a href="https://www.arteria.ai/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Arteria AI</a>. Prior to that, I completed my M.Sc. (Thesis-based) in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">York University</a> where I was working as a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/enamulh/index.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Prof. Enamul Hoque</a>. in collaboration with <a href="https://raihanjoty.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Prof. Shafiq Joty</a>, who is currently a research director at <a href="https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">Salesforce AI Research</a>. My research focused on multimodal charts understanding tasks, such as answering questions about charts, summarizing charts, and extracting data from charts.

Our research work has been accepted in several prestigious conferences such as **ACL 2022**, **CVPR 2021**, **EuroVis 2022**, **EMNLP 2023**, **AAAI 2024**, and **ACL 2024**. Moreover, our work has gained considerable attention; our <a href="https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA" style="text-decoration: none; color: #99FF9FF;">ChartQA benchmark</a> has been featured as a key multimodal evaluation benchmark by **OpenAI's GPT-4** official blog post and **Google's Gemini** paper in evaluating their models visual reasoning capabilities. 
Finally, our chart understanding models have been downloaded over 34,000 times from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ahmed-masry), with a monthly average of 5,000 downloads!
