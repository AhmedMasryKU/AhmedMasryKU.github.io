# Publication Images

Place your publication thumbnail images in this folder.

## Naming Convention

Name your images to match the `teaser` field in your publication markdown files. For example:

- If your publication has `teaser: chartgemma.png`, place the image as `chartgemma.png` in this folder
- If your publication has `teaser: my-paper.jpg`, place the image as `my-paper.jpg` in this folder

## Image Specifications

- **Recommended size**: 200x120 pixels (or maintain a similar aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or WebP
- **Content**: Typically a figure from the paper, a diagram, or a visual summary

## Example

For a publication file `_publications/2025-01-01-chartgemma.md` with:
```yaml
header:
  teaser: chartgemma.png
```

Place the image at: `images/publications/chartgemma.png`
